      <p class="text-l sm:text-xl leading-normal mb-8">For my BEng Chemical Engineering design project, I was tasked with designing a continuously operated distillation column. This distillation column was to be used on a manufacturing site to produce pectin from raw orange peel - the design could produce approximately 142 tonnes of pectin per annum to be integrated into a jam manufacturing process as well as sold as a powdered product. The final design for the ethanol column enabled the recovery of 95 wt.% of all ethanol used in upstream processes.</p>
      <div class="img-dist w-full hidden md:block md:h-96 bg-contain mb-8 bg-no-repeat bg-center"></div>
      <p class="text-l sm:text-xl leading-normal mb-6">Ethanol is used in the process to purify the previously extracted pectin â€” the pectin feed is mixed with ethanol in a 2:1 (v/v) solvent ratio to coagulate the pectin into a gel-like substance. Pectin is insoluble in ethanol, so upon mixing it precipitates out of the mixture as a gel leaving the majority of the impurities in the ethanol solution. The pectin solution is mixed with ethanol at a greater concentration downstream to further purify the pectin gel for food and medical usage. Impurities removed in the downstream processes include mono and disaccharides and acid remnants from a previous hydrolysis stage in the process.</p>
    <p class="text-l sm:text-xl leading-normal mb-6">The washed gel is sent to a mechanical press where 50 wt.% of the liquid is removed from the gel. A belt conveyor dryer is then used to dry the pressed pectin gel to a moisture content of 5 wt.% before it is milled into a fine white powder. The large consumption of ethanol in the purification stages required distillation column apparatus - the recovered ethanol can be recycled as a feedstock for the precipitation and washing stages.</p>
    <p class="text-l sm:text-xl leading-normal mb-6">You can <a href="/src/files/design-project.pdf" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-dark">download my design of the distillation column</a> which details all the methods used to design the ethanol-recovery distillation column. The report also includes detailed specification sheets for all major units used in the stages described above, as well as engineering drawings for the distillation column and value plates, and a piping and instrumentation diagram which details the control and operation of the pectin purification process. Benefits of the distillation column are also shown through cost-analysis, which details that a saving of $2 million dollars per annum can be saved through recycling ethanol.</p>
